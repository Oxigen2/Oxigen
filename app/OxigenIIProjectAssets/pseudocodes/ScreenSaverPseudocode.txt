Level 1:

two asset objects: current asset, next asset

Every 50 milliseconds do this:

  if current asset's display time elapsed (asset or "no assets" image)
      
       add current asset's display length to cumulative display times
       write current display log for asset
        
       display next asset in memory and load another in a separate thread
       
       if no asset found
             display bouncing graphic
             when next loop reaches here, don't start displaying the box again but continue moving it
             
Repeat above steps every 50 miliseconds



ScreenSaver constructor:
  
  select asset A
  load asset A (not in a separate thread)
  
  if no asset A found
    display bouncing graphic (in a separate thread)
  else
    display asset A (in a separate thread)
    
  select asset B, load asset B (in a separate thread)  
  if no asset B found
    display bouncing graphic (in a separate thread)
  else
    display asset (in a separate thread)
  
  Enable the 50 ms timer
  
  show this one screensaver

Level 2:

two asset objects: current asset, next asset

Every 50 milliseconds do this:

  if current asset's display time elapsed or bouncing box is shown
  
       if asset A is being displayed
        add asset A's to cumulative display times
        write display log for asset A
       else
        add asset B's to cumulative display times
        write display log for asset B
        
       if there is a running thread that selects and loads the next asset from disk
          halt here until it's finished
        
       if (asset designated by toggle is not null)
        display asset designated by toggle
       else
        display bouncing graphic
        when next loop reaches here, don't start displaying the box again but continue moving it
        
       switch the toggle
       
       Load asset designated by new toggle
                    
Repeat above steps every 50 miliseconds


display next asset in memory and load another

  display asset designated by toggle
  switch the toggle
  select next asset (in separate thread)
  load next asset (same thread as select next asset)      

end of display next asset in memory and load another

ScreenSaver constructor:
  
  select asset A
  load asset A (not in a separate thread)
  
  if no asset A found
    nullify asset A
    display bouncing graphic
  else
    display asset A (in a separate thread)
  
  select and load asset B (in a separate thread)
  show this screensaver
  
  Enable the 50 millisecond timer
