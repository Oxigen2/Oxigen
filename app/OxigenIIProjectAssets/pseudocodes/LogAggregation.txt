Open an X number of 'small' files _of a specific type_ and keep into memory. No need to be locked
  if one fails, move to the next. Maybe files are less than X. No need for file streams: only aggregator
  touches those files.
  
Inflate each file into many classes so the contents can be used in LINQ.

do aggregation

save 'big' file

If 'big' file successfully saved
  delete small files
  if deletion of a small file is not successful
    leave it and move to the next
