We ask for some personal information when you create an account, including your email address and a password which is used to protect your account from unauthorised access.</p>
    <p>Usage Information. When you use Oxigen, we may record information about your usage of the system, such as the streams to which you subscribe, the frequency with which you use the Oxigen service as well as information that you click in Oxigen (including UI elements, settings). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your Oxigen Account. In order to ensure the quality of our service to you, we may place a tag in customer support emails or other communications with you in order to confirm delivery.</p>
    <p>Content Uploaded to Site. Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (e.g. content, stream tags, your profile page) may be collected and used by others. If you download the Oxigen Player, your copy includes a unique identification number. This number and information about your installation and use of the Oxigen Player will be sent to Oxigen periodically.  The Oxigen Player automatically checks for updates and will be used to update your version of the Oxigen Player.</p>
