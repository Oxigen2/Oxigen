  <h2>Respect the Oxigen Community</h2>
  <p>Oxigen is a community-based content sharing platform.  As with any community, Oxigen relies on its users to show a level of responsibility and trust to each other.  Please respect our community as you would wish to be respected by others.</p>
  <h2>We Review Content Flagged As Inappropriate</h2>
  <p>When content gets flagged as inappropriate, we review the content to determine whether it violates our <a href="Terms.aspx">Terms of Service</a>.  Flagged content is not taken down automatically by the system. If we remove your content after reviewing it, you can assume that we removed it purposefully and you should take our warning notification seriously. Take a deep breath, read our <a href="Terms.aspx">Terms of Service</a> and try to see it from our perspective. If you find other content on Oxigen with the same violations, please flag them so that we can review them as well.</p>
  <h2>Don't Cross the Line</h2>
  <p>Here are some common-sense rules that will help you steer clear of trouble:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oxigen is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. If this describes your content, don't post it on Oxigen. Also, be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.</li>
    <li>Don't post content showing things like animal abuse, drug abuse or bomb making.</li>
    <li>Graphic or gratuitous violence is not allowed. If your content shows someone getting hurt, attacked or humiliated, don't post it.</li>
    <li>Oxigen is not a shock site. Don't post disgusting content of accidents, dead bodies and similar things.</li>
    <li>Respect copyright. Only upload content that you created or that you are authorised to use. This means don't upload content that you didn't make or use content to which someone else owns the copyright, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programmes or videos made by other users, without necessary authorisation.</li>
    <li>We encourage free speech and defend everyone's right to express unpopular points of view. But we do not permit hate speech (speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status and sexual orientation/gender identity). </li>
    <li>There is zero tolerance for predatory behaviour, stalking, threats, harassment, invading privacy or the revealing of other members' personal information. Anyone caught doing these things may be banned permanently from Oxigen.</li>
    <li>Everyone hates spam. Do not create misleading descriptions, tags, titles or thumbnails in order to increase views. It's not OK to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content.</li>
  </ul>  
  <p>Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't look for loopholes; just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created. Violations of the Terms of Service may result in a warning notification or termination of your account. If your account is terminated, you are prohibited from creating any new accounts.</p>
  <h2>Oxigen is a Community</h2>
  <p>Remember that this is your community.  Please be a positive member of the community and take responsibility for upholding the community’s values.  If you find content on Oxigen which you think violates our <a href="Terms.aspx">Terms of Service</a>, please flag that content so we may review it and if necessary, remove it from Oxigen.</p>
