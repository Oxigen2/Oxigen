But he was accused by his Labour shadow, Ed Balls, of "scaremongering" after stressing that the deepening problems of the single currency had a domestic significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial markets responded calmly to the news that Portugal had finally sought help from its EU partners but, amid concerns that Spain could be the next target for speculative attack, Brussels said its plea would be treated "in the swiftest possible manner".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure on the weaker countries of the 17-nation eurozone was increasedwhen the European Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in almost three years. The ECB had put pressure on a reluctant Portugal to drop its hardline opposition to a bailout amid concerns that Portuguese banks were becoming too reliant on ECB funding. "We have encouraged the Portuguese authorities to ask for support," said Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the ECB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain ruled out the possibility that it would be the next to buckle. Finance minister Elena Salgado said Spain's economy "is more diversified, more powerful with sound basics, and is much more competitive" than Portugal's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development backed Spain's chances of avoiding a bailout: "Spain will not have the same problems as Portugal has been facing because it has been addressing those problems for quite some time," said Angel Gurría, the secretary general of the Paris-based thinktank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the Bank of England left borrowing costs on hold at 0.5% as Osborne used a keynote speech to the British Chambers of Commerce to spell out the government's case for deficit reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you hear the stories about the cuts and still wonder why our country needs to take these difficult decisions, then look at what is happening around us. First Greece, then Ireland, today Portugal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of them countries that did not convince the world they could pay their debts. Two of them countries with smaller budget deficits than Britain. Now all of them being bailed out, at huge costs to their populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today of all days we can see the risks that would face Britain, if we were not dealing with our debts and paying off our national credit card. These risks are not imaginary – they are very, very real. Those in our country who deny the urgent need to deal with our deficit are playing Russian roulette with Britain's national sovereignty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balls, speaking to Sky News, said: "I think this is a desperate piece of scaremongering from what is an increasingly desperate chancellor who looks out of his depth. If anybody is playing Russian roulette with the British economy, it is George Osborne taking a huge gamble now without any idea how it's going to turn out. That may be good political lines but it is very bad economics. And it's taking huge risks with jobs and businesses and family finances up and down the country. I think he has got this very, very badly wrong and he will rue this day with this blatant politicking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts to resolve Portugal's crisis speedily were being hindered by Lisbon's political vacuum and over whether a caretaker government had sufficient authority to negotiate bailout terms that are likely to prove unpopular. The European commission and the ECB are expected to dispatch experts to Lisbon as early as next week to pore over the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anders Borg, Sweden's finance minister, condemned Portugal's delay in asking for help. "We have reason to direct sharp criticism against the Portuguese. They have placed themselves and Europe in a very difficult situation," he complained. "They should have requested aid much earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portugal last month became the second country in a few months to suffer a government collapse because of the European debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike Ireland, and previously Greece, the negotiations with Lisbon involve a lame duck prime minister, José Socrates, who lacks the electoral legitimacy to impose the kind of austerity and spending cuts that the eurozone will demand as the price of rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that Socrates will have to strike a deal with the main opposition centre-right Social Democrats in order to secure a negotiating mandate. The collapse of his government last month means that Portugal has been thrust into an early election, with the ballot on 5 June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then it needs to raise around €10bn, meaning that EU funds would need to be disbursed before the election. EU governments are eager to avoid a repeat of the Irish scenario, where the government negotiated the bailout deal, then lost an election and its successor sought to unpick the terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid speculation about a "bridging loan" to tide Portugal over until the elections, Brussels and Berlin stressed that, legally, the sole instruments available were the two temporary vehicles created last May, the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility – the first totalling €60bn administered by the commission (with Britain liable for 13.7%) and the second comprising €440bn in eurozone government loan guarantees. Access to those funds requires "strict conditionality".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also highly probable that the International Monetary Fund, at German insistence, will need to be involved, whether Socrates wants it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;European debt crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending"&gt;Tax and spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/european-central-bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-sector-cuts"&gt;Public sector cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/policy"&gt;Public services policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance"&gt;Public finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/larryelliott"&gt;Larry Elliott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iantraynor"&gt;Ian Traynor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Dealers say about 500,000 tonnes of cocoa are stuck in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have also asked the [West African] central bank, BCEAO, to reopen its branches in Ivory Coast, to ensure a resumption of operations in all banks so as to enable the payment of salaries and arrears in the shortest possible time," he said on the LCI channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As for the outgoing president, Mr Laurent Gbagbo, who has entrenched himself at the presidential residence in Cocody with heavy weapons and mercenaries, a blockade has been established around the perimeter to secure the inhabitants of the district," Ouattara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/07/un-forces-surround-gbagbo-troops" title=""&gt;Diplomatic and military efforts to oust Gbagbo&lt;/a&gt; have been met with fierce resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week of fighting for control of the economic capital of Abidjan has overwhelmed hospitals with casualties, caused frequent powercuts and left residents scrambling to find food and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every morning people have to take jerrycans to walk around the neighbourhood and search for water," Cocody resident Jean-Claude said. "As for food, there is nothing left. People have to queue up in long lines to buy even a single baguette."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UN peacekeepers have surrounded Gbagbo's "last defenders", France said yesterday. The French defence minister, Gérard Longuet, said Gbagbo had about 1,000 men defending him, 200 of whom were inside the residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UN spokesman in Abidjan said UN forces were on standby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have sent a patrol to Cocody and the surrounding area, but it is not to intervene," UN spokesman Hamadoun Toure said. "I am not aware that Ouattara has requested our intervention at this stage." Helicopters from French forces and the UN peacekeeping mission bombarded Gbagbo's weapons stockpiles earlier this week, including those near his residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political analysts said Ouattara forces, who swept south last week in a lightly contested march toward Abidjan, could struggle to defeat Gbagbo's remaining presidential guard without French and UN help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ouattara meanwhile said he had asked his generals to take all necessary steps to maintain order and security of goods, people and their movements and also to secure the delivery of food to markets and medicines to hospitals and health centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said steps would also be taken to shed light on all crimes committed during the conflict and that he would collaborate with international organisations to investigate human rights abuses and punish those found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor at the international criminal court said this week that he was in talks with West African states about referring alleged atrocities in the Ivory Coast to the court after a reported massacre in the west of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have established a national commission of inquiry whose findings will be made public and the perpetrators of crimes will be severely punished," Ouattara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gbagbo has ruled Ivory Coast since 2000 and blames Paris for supporting the north of the country in the 2002-2003 civil war. Rebels from that war now make up the bulk of Ouattara's force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ivory-coast"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/alassane-ouattara"&gt;Alassane Ouattara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/laurent-gbagbo"&gt;Laurent Gbagbo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Cameron is reluctant to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defence secretary, Liam Fox, would have been wounded politically if he had been forced to impose fresh cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is some scepticism that the deal agreed by the Treasury and the MoD will produce the savings the two sides claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MoD said the deal for the 2011 budget meant there would be no additional cuts this year to armed forces manpower, equipment or capabilities over and above SDSR decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal finalised on Wednesday, the MoD has saved £100m by renegotiating the terms of as many as 500 contracts. The deal will also probably require the MoD to delay the purchase of equipment including some helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also agreed to removing 80% of defence equipment and support marketing, reductions in civilian expenses, a 50% reduction in media and PR costs, a cut in the number of photographers, and the sale of some parts of the MoD's broadband spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox is also imposing a new cost control regime on the MoD in a bid to get its escalating costs under control. However there is scepticism that this package will lead to sufficient savings given the MoD's past failures to control its budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury has given ground by saying it will not claw back the savings the MoD makes as a result of the decommissioning of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor George Osborne has also agreed that the operational allowance, the top-up paid to soldiers on active duty worth £29.02 a day, will be fully funded by the Treasury. Previously the MoD had to pay half the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details will be given to the Commons when MPs return after the Easter break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MoD insists there will be no reopening of the strategic defence review, even though some senior military figures insist the status of the review is a live discussion. One senior figure disclosed: "There's a lot of objective thinking going on. The uncertain world we envisaged coming down the track is here now".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron is keen not be seen to be inflexible about the SDSR, but would not want a full scale reopening of its assumptions and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SDSR was designed to tackle a £38bn defence shortfall and an equipment programme that was over committed and unsustainable after 13 years without a defence review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defence sources maintain that the UK has enough Tornado strike aircraft, and the abolition of two squadrons will not see an overall reduction in the number of planes. The Tornado is needed in both Afghanistan and the no-fly zone in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic defence review is due to last five years, and some defence ministers argue there is no point revisiting the exercise unless there is a prospect that the funding will also increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defence minister Nick Harvey said this week on BBC Daily Politics: "If we have the same envelope of cash, if we went back to reviewing the defence equation I think we would come to the same conclusions. Nothing that has happened since has led us fundamentally to question the decisions we made at the time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/defence"&gt;Defence policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liamfox"&gt;Liam Fox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Judge Peter Thornton QC, who is sitting as the deputy assistant coroner, has stated that there is "no criticism" of police medics, paramedics, ambulance staff, doctors or members of the public who went to Tomlinon's aid. He said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="quoted"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no criticism of any of them, either in terms of their arrival or in terms of the nature of the treatment and procedures which are carried out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this is an issue. The reason for our listening to these witnesses, whether they are read to you or come live to the witness box, is that this is all part of the medical narrative from the time of Mr Tomlinson's collapse in Cornhill and may be relevant later when the cause of his death is more closely considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 9 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;11.43am:&lt;/span&gt; The hearing is being adjourned for a quick break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 8 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;11.33am:&lt;/span&gt; Miskowvicz says her colleagues were unable to get intravenous access (needles into Tomlinson's veins to administer drugs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questioned by Ryder, she confirms that it can be difficult to find veins when there is not enough blood in them due to blood loss or low blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, she confirms that there were a number of problems she could rule out, but two that she couldn't – that Tomlinson was suffering from hypovolemia (internal bleeding) or that he had a thromboembolism (blood clot).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryder has finished questioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 7 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;11.21am:&lt;/span&gt; Matthew Ryder QC, the counsel for Tomlinson's family, has begun questoining Miskowvicz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He clarified with the paramedic that when she said she was called to deal with a cardiac arrest, that was not the result of any diagnosis. Miskowvicz agreed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="quoted"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was, I guess, suspected when members of the public call and say it is a cardiac arrest ... it is difficult to know whether it is or not until we arrive on scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The jury &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2011/mar/29/ian-tomlinson-inquest-live-updates?INTCMP=SRCH 0"&gt;heard on day one&lt;/a&gt; that, whether Tomlinson died of a coronary heart disease or internal bleeding was likely to be one a point of "controversy" in the inquest.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paramedic also reiterates that the no pulse can be a result of internal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 6 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;11.01am:&lt;/span&gt; Miskowvicz told the jury that she attended what she was told was a cardiac arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomlinson was lying on his back on Cornhill, being treated by police medics. There was no pulse, and he was not breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she attached a defibrillator at 19.37pm, she said the readings on the screen indicated a "known cardiac arrest rhythm". But there were two other possible causes for the readings – a "blood clot" blocking proper circulation, or massive internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPR treatment was carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 5 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;10.38am:&lt;/span&gt; Next up: Karen Miskowvicz, a paramedic team leader for the London Ambulance Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 4 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;10.25am:&lt;/span&gt; As with Tomlinson's other doctor, Dr Ugwu gave evidence about the father of nine's problem with alcoholism and health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the newspaper seller was keen to take part in detoxification programmes to overcome his alcoholism, and was on a lot of medication. The coroner thanks the doctor for his "short and sweet" testimony, and he leaves the stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 3 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;10.14am:&lt;/span&gt; Proceedings have started. The first witness is Dr Paul Ugwu, one of Tomlinson's GPs. He saw the newspaper seller on four occasions prior to his death on 1 April 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 2 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;10.00am:&lt;/span&gt; There was also evidence from protesters who went to Tomlinson's aid, which you can &lt;a href="http://www.tomlinsoninquest.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F777187B-3DAD-44A8-B292-0273425D8BEE/0/070411am.pdf"&gt;read here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last witness to take the stand yesterday was Dr Vasserman, Tomlinson's GP. He said Tomlinson was a chronic alcoholic, had an enlarged spleen and liver and suffered from a condition called periphery neuropathy, which affected his nervous system and made him generally unsteady on his feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been taken to hospital ten times in the two years leading up to his death after falling over while drunk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up this morning will be Dr Paul Ugwu, the last GP to examine Tomlinson, followed by ambulance and hospital staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 1 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;9.58am:&lt;/span&gt; Welcome to day nine of the Ian Tomlinson inquest, which we're expecting to focus on more medical evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are catching up, the most widely reported evidence came from Kamran Saleem, a charity manager who saw Tomlinson fall to the ground a few minutes after, and 100 yards down the road from, being struck by PC Simon Harwood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saleem &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/apr/07/ian-tomlinson-last-words-revealed"&gt;told the jury he overhead Tomlinson tell another bystander&lt;/a&gt;: "They got me, the fuckers got me." His full statement was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="quoted"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think when somebody went to help, he said something along the lines of – I think it is in my statement – "They have got me, the fuckers got me", and then I think somebody asked him if he wanted an ambulance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "No, they got me," or something ... It was probably quieter than normal, but it was kind of like an anger, it was like: "They got me," but probably more surprised than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson"&gt;Ian Tomlinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/g20"&gt;G20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/protest"&gt;Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullewis"&gt;Paul Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

The body of the killer, who reportedly committed suicide after being shot by police, remains unclaimed in the city morgue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As police attempted to piece together a profile of the 23-year-old gunman, named as Wellington Menezes de Oliveira, further details emerged of the slaughter inside the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students said Oliveira – a former pupil now dubbed "the monster of Realengo" by local tabloids – entered the building at around 8am claiming to be giving a lecture. After talking to one former teacher he made his way up a flight of stairs to classroom three where students, mostly girls, were lined up, and shot many at point-blank range in the head and chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mateus Moraes, 13, told the O Dia newspaper that Oliveira had deliberately killed a number of girls but spared the boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He killed the girls with shots to the head," Moraes said. "The boys, he just shot to injure, in the arms or the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I asked him not to kill me and he said: 'Relax, Fatty, I'm not going to kill you,'" added Moraes. "As he reloaded the gun I just prayed. God saved me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grisly photographs taken inside classroom three were printed by one local newspaper and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/07/brazil-shooting-rampage-gunman" title=""&gt;CCTV footage showing part of the rampage&lt;/a&gt; was also leaked, although editors decided most of the images were too disturbing to publish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photographs showed open textbooks and backpacks scattered on top of a jumble of blood-stained chairs and desks. Golden bullet-cases littered the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jade Ramos Araújo, 12, was sitting a science test when Oliveira burst into her classroom, wearing a dark blue jacket and with an ammunition belt strapped to his waist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was shouting at the children: 'Face the wall because I'm going to kill you,'" she told the Brazilian news website IG. "The children shouted, begging: 'Don't kill me, young man.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was like a waterfall of blood, with blood flowing like water. The were lots of dead people on the stairs, more girls than boys."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 12-year-old student told the Guardian the gunman had been "well-dressed". "He came into our room and said he was going to kill everyone. I thought I was going to die." Asked if she would return to study at Tasso da Silveira school, the girl shook her head. "I am leaving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's justice minister, José Eduardo Cardozo, promised a government "crusade" against gun ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to fight strongly against this culture of armament, against this culture that makes people … commit this kind of atrocity," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dilma-rousseff"&gt;Dilma Rousseff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tomphillips"&gt;Tom Phillips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

The original photo has been replaced because the brand pictured was not mentioned in the story as one of those involved in the milk controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/food"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

The marches were prompted by the torture and murder of Juan Francisco Sicilia, the son of a well-loved poet, along with six other people with no links to the cartels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a national emergency," Sicilia's father Javier said during the biggest of the marches held in the city of Cuernavaca, just outside the capital, where the murders took place. "Mexico doesn't want to labour under this stupid war any more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 35,000 people have died in violence related to the drug war since President Felipe Calderón launched a military-led offensive against the cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government blames the death toll on a series of turf battles raging on different fronts across the country and involving at least six different cartels. It insists that the vast majority of the victims are associated with the gangs, and that the federal forces are having significant success in weakening them. Although Calderón accepts that civilians uninvolved in the drug war are also dying, he rejects growing demands for a change of strategy that formed one of the main themes of this week's protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should all join the condemnation of the violence generated by the criminals and the absolute conviction of the federal government to continue to confront criminality," he said in a statement released in response to the discovery of the graves in Tamaulipas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight pits, one of which contained 43 corpses, were found not far from the ranch were &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/25/mexico-massacre-central-american-migrants" title=""&gt;72 Central and South American migrants were massacred eight months ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state authorities said the first three to be identified from the latest grisly discovery were Mexicans, and that two were women. Social media buzzed with rumours that there were more bodies yet to be officially accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tamaulipas has become a narcograve," @algomendez tweeted on Thursday. The phrase was retweeted throughout the day, as residents described their sense of impotence in a state terrorised by &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2010/sep/03/mexico-drugs-trade-interactive-map" title=""&gt;a war between the Gulf and Zeta cartels&lt;/a&gt; which federal forces seems powerless to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killings in Cuernavaca, meanwhile, have had a profound impact on the middle classes and the intelligentsia in and around the capital, who previously felt themselves somewhat immune from the violence. One banner in the Mexico City march read: "Today a student, tomorrow a corpse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six were killed on 28 March after leaving a bar in Cuernavaca. They had been reportedly talking about the violence that has shaken the area since last year, though it is still much more sporadic than in Tamaulipas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local authorities said they had issued warrants for the arrest of two suspects who are former members of the security forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/drugs-trade"&gt;Drugs trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jotuckman"&gt;Jo Tuckman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>US to tweet terror attack warnings</title>

It describes the behind-the-scenes process when the US comes under attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terror alerts may be broadcast on Twitter and Facebook only "when appropriate", according to the hitherto top-secret document. Terror threats are made public only when members of Congress, various counter-terrorism officials, governors and mayors have been informed. The document even specifies how many minutes US officials can wait before organising urgent conference calls to discuss pending threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new advisory system is designed to be easier to understand and more specific. The present warning levels have been lampooned by comedians and criticised by TV broadcasters for being too vague and open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the draft plan, the Homeland Security unit will issue targeted warnings based on the threat. For example, if there is a specific threat that terrorists are looking to hide explosives in US airports, the government might issue a public warning that would be announced in airports telling travellers to be extra vigilant and report any suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new system, an "elevated" alert would warn of a credible threat against the US. It would likely not specify timing nor targets, but it could reveal terrorist trends that intelligence officials believe should be shared in order to prevent an attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An "imminent" alert would warn about a credible, specific and impending terrorist threat or an ongoing attack against the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/blogging"&gt;Blogging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/socialnetworking"&gt;Social networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josh-halliday"&gt;Josh Halliday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Viacom said that the iPad app – which Time Warner says has been downloaded more than 360,000 times – would result in "substantial and irreparable injury" to its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time Warner protests that its customers should be able to watch programming on as many screens as they wish – and that its existing contract with the channels allows this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Time Warner executive vice-president and general counsel, Marc Lawrence-Apfelbaum, said yesterday: "We have steadfastly maintained that we have the rights to allow our customers to view this programming in their homes, over our cable systems, without artificial limits on the screens they can use to do so, and we are asking the court to confirm our view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the court's judgment will not order any action to be taken, it could set an important precedent for digital viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other US cable companies, such as Cablevision, are expected to release similar iPad apps shortly, as they look to exploit viewers' move towards portable devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the BBC's iPlayer app for the iPad delivers more than 2m requests for programmes a month, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2011/03/fenruary_2011_bbciplayer_perfo.html" title="latest figures"&gt;latest figures&lt;/a&gt; for February. Since their launch on 10 February, the Android and iPad apps for iPlayer have been downloaded about 500,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•&amp;nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

The previous year he had received no cash bonus and stock awards of just above $14.1m. In 2008, the year of the financial crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Dimon received just his base salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has run JP Morgan since December 2005. The bank fared much better than its Wall Street rivals during the financial crisis, acquiring Bear Stearns in 2007 and Washington Mutual a year later. The bank made &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jan/14/jp-morgan-bankers-share-10bn" title="a net profit of $17.4bn in 2010"&gt;a net profit of $17.4bn in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, almost 50% higher than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hillman, spokesperson for the &lt;a href="http://robinhoodtax.org/" title="Robin Hood Tax campaign"&gt;Robin Hood Tax campaign&lt;/a&gt;, described Dimon's pay deal as "the latest example of the bloated pay and profits of the banking sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks that have escaped the consequences of an economic crisis they caused should be made to pay a Robin Hood Tax to help those still struggling with its effects," Hillman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Robin Hood, or transactional, tax would involve a very small levy on each financial transaction conducted by a bank. Supporters say it would raise about £20bn in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also show JP Morgan paid Dimon $421,458 in moving expenses, $95,293 to cover "personal use of aircraft" and $45,730 for "personal use of car".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan explained the Dimon family had moved from Chicago to New York in 2007 after their children finished high school, but only found a buyer for their old house in 2010. The moving expenses include more than $300,000 in real estate agency commission and fees, but do not cover the likely fall in the value of the house due to the slump in the US housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not the firm's policy to reimburse employees for losses incurred on the sale of a home in connection with a relocation and no such reimbursement is included in the amounts listed as moving expense," JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of Dimon's pay package came just a week after it emerged that Goldman Sachs had &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/apr/02/lloyd-blankfein-executive-pay-bonuses" title="almost doubled the pay of its CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, to $18.6m"&gt;almost doubled the pay of its CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, to $18.6m&lt;/a&gt;. That included a $5.4m performance-related cash bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/jpmorgan"&gt;JP Morgan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/executive-pay-bonuses"&gt;Executive pay and bonuses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy"&gt;US economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/graemewearden"&gt;Graeme Wearden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

A 79-year-old man died of shock and a woman in her 60s was killed when power was cut to her oxygen tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears that the magnitude 7.1 quake, the strongest since the tsunami, would set off another series of huge waves subsided with the lifting of a tsunami warning about 90 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nuclear plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said Thursday's earthquake had not caused further damage to the facility, adding that workers battling to cool down overheating reactors had temporarily retreated to an on-site quake-resistant shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest earthquake caused power outages across a wide area of northern Japan and knocked out several power lines at Onagawa nuclear power station north of Sendai city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One remaining power line continued to supply electricity as normal, and there have been no reports of abnormal radiation levels in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant's spent fuel pools briefly lost cooling capacity but an emergency diesel generator quickly kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earthquake struck 30 miles beneath the water off the coast of Sendai, about the same depth and location as the magnitude 9.0 quake on 11 March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earthquake hit shortly after 11.30pm local time. The violent shaking lasted about 30 seconds, hurling items on to the floor in the neighbourhood near the city's main railway station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Miyagi prefecture motorways were closed and bullet train services were partially suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sendai hotel guests and diners filed on to streets, some clutching torches as they began walking home in near-darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirens from emergency vehicles filled the air, but more than three hours later there were no reports of major damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police and the fire service officials said they had received numerous calls about fires and gas leaks. NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, said seven people had been injured, two of them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earthquake sent the dollar sliding against the yen and wiped out early gains in European stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency said progress was being made to stabilise the Fukushima Daiichi plant, where workers have been injecting nitrogen into a reactor to prevent a potentially explosive build-up of hydrogen gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remains very serious," Denis Flory, head of the IAEA's nuclear safety department, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he added: "There are early signs of recovery in some functions such as electrical power and instrumentation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami"&gt;Japan disaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/natural-disasters"&gt;Natural disasters and extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/justinmccurry"&gt;Justin McCurry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

This is being investigated. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field refused to comment on the allegations when  the Sun approached him at his home in Warminster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/judiciary"&gt;Judiciary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

But which songs bring tears to the eyes of Guardian writers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/timjonze/playlist/2ri7niOhoCI79Y8uWd5IqV"&gt;Add the songs that make you weep to our collaborative Spotify playlist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9xPNaq9uec" title="Broken Heart  Spiritualized"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken Heart – Spiritualized&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad fell ill just before I left home and he never got better. I was optimistic enough to believe he would, or maybe not grown-up enough to countenance the alternative. He was from a family who believed negative emotions should be packed away in a box and discreetly buried. So we didn't talk about the fact that he was clearly depressed by his illness. Instead we talked about movies and TV shows, books and records. We both loved Spiritualized's 1997 album Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space. A few months before he died, he mentioned in passing that he often played Broken Heart over and over. This is a song so opulently miserable that it's almost a parody of heartbreak songs. You shouldn't ever feel the way the narrator does. It's too much. I should have taken the opportunity to talk to my dad about his terrible sadness, but I didn't. The song was played at his funeral and became, emotionally speaking, a grenade with the pin half out. I couldn't listen to it again until, almost 10 years later, I saw Spiritualized play the entire album at the Royal Festival Hall. When they reached Broken Heart I almost levitated with sorrow, hit by the realisation that this song represented the conversation we never had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dorian Lynskey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iNRZBGeTZU" title="Silent Night"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent Night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (trad)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some might find slightly pathetic the fact that, when asked to name the song that makes me cry, my first thought was how to whittle it down to just one. Or even 10. But then, considering the emotional power of music and the way it entwines itself around defining moments of your life, I'd find it more pathetic if someone &lt;em&gt;couldn't&lt;/em&gt; name a song that made them blub like a big old stupid baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the mistake, for instance, of listening to Antony and the Johnsons' I Am A Bird Now during a traumatic breakup six years ago and still don't dare play the track &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Br07CF0qk" title="Bird Gerhl"&gt;Bird Gerhl&lt;/a&gt; in public for fear people will rush over and pack me off to the nearest therapist. For similar reasons I can't even risk playing my favourite song of all time out in the street – &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQU4torUz-Q" title="Sam Cookes A Change Is Gonna Come"&gt;Sam Cooke's A Change Is Gonna Come&lt;/a&gt; (blame John Pilger, who used it as the closing track on his unbelievably moving documentary, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/page/0,,2150097,00.html" title="The War On Democracy"&gt;The War On Democracy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the song that makes me well up most of all is the Christmas carol Silent Night. The melody is bound up with the magic but also the melancholy of Christmas. As December approaches I can't go near a church. Or leave the house. Or answer the door. Or watch the sodding EastEnders Christmas special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim Jonze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAuvxO3zVc" title="When You Need a Laugh   Patsy Cline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When You Need a Laugh –  Patsy Cline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Songs I've heard at dawn return to make me cry in daylight, however saccharine and bloated (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra-Om7UMSJc" title="Kelly Clarksons Because of You"&gt;Kelly Clarkson's Because of You&lt;/a&gt;, please be kind). But it's Cline I reach for when I need a lovely weep. Specifically, When You Need a Laugh – the truest, most painful song in the world, the story of a girl who keeps returning to her unrequited love even though he rips the piss out of her and thinks she's a dick. "At least I'm on your mind when you're laughing, somehow that breaks the fall. So when you need a laugh, give me a call." Have sadder words ever been sung?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eva Wiseman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3hSW0EsBzU" title="Candide – Leonard Bernstein"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candide – Leonard Bernstein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an opera, or an operetta or a musical, however you want to describe it, Candide has its problems. No fewer than six people, including Dorothy Parker, Lillian Hellmann, Stephen Sondheim and Bernstein himself, not to mention Voltaire, had a hand in the book and lyrics, and each time it was revived musical numbers were added or removed. Now there's no such thing as a definitive version of the score, and each performance has its awkward corners, its moments when everything sags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet all of that is forgotten and forgiven in the last 20 minutes, from the moment Candide sings Nothing More Than This, his bitter aria of self-revelation, right through to the final chorus &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XNd0BT3bHo" title="Make Our Garden Grow"&gt;Make Our Garden Grow&lt;/a&gt;. Set to music of almost Mahlerian intensity, it's the antithesis of the easy-fix, happily-ever-after ending – an affirmation that "Life is life and all we know" and that you can only live your life by accepting your own shortcomings and taking people for what they are and not for what you want them to be. It's an extraordinary passage, devastatingly truthful and overwhelmingly, unfailingly touching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Clements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE-bnWqLqxE" title="Ex-Factor  Lauryn Hill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex-Factor – Lauryn Hill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most songs about breakups are retrospective, with the deed already done and the heart already broken, but Hill takes you right into the middle of it. Ex-Factor is a misleading title because he's not quite an ex just yet, although the song hangs on the fact that the split is inevitable. But the real grief of it is in the crushing confusion. "I just can't be with no one else," she sings&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;, immediately following it with "I know what we've got to do – you let go and I'll let go too." But knowing that it needs to end is not the same as ending it, which she can't bring herself to do, and the fade-out of "Where were you when I needed you?" is a devastating finish, suggesting it could so easily have been avoided. I first heard it as a student, too young to imagine that love could ever be so blurry; as life happens, the jumble of longing and despair starts to make perfect sense, and I appear to have something in my eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Nicholson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwOU3bnuU0k" title="I Just Called to Say I Love You  Stevie Wonder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Just Called To Say I Love You – Stevie Wonder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most unlikely song can knock the stuffing out of you because it catches you unawares, in a heightened emotional state. I had intended to celebrate the birth of my first daughter by listening to something that combined aptness with a degree of cool: I liked the idea of Joey Ramone's version of What A Wonderful World or Neil Young's New Mama. As it was, the birth was chaotic and I didn't have time to arrange a suitable post-natal soundtrack: driving home alone from the hospital after a sleepless night, I turned on the radio. I wasn't even paying attention until I Just Called To Say I Love You, as awful a record as a bona fide musical genius has ever made, came on. At that moment, however, I was struck by the manifold loveliness of the sentiment – he's just calling to say "I love you"! He means it from the bottom of his heart! – with such force that I had to pull over, even though the song made no sense whatsoever in my current situation. The protagonist spends the whole thing explaining that he has no particularly pressing reason to say he loves you, which I clearly had, and that in fact it's just another ordinary day. This wasn't the way I would have described the preceding 13 hours, which had included the terrible moment when I decided to peek at what was going on at the business end of a caesarean section, and now found me sitting in a layby, crying. Then the terrible little ending kicked in – cha-cha-cha! – and I collected myself and drove home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexis Petridis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iW5U4i-Z74" title="Someone Great  LCD Soundsystem"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Someone Great –  LCD Soundsystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My oldest brother, best friend and subject of my teenage hero worship, can probably take a bit of credit for my obsession with LCD's epic bleep-making. He introduced me to most of what I remain giddily attached to even today (New Order; newspapers; American literature; my husband). Four years ago to the week, we had a massive falling-out and haven't really spoken since. At the same time, I heard this on a bus and was set on silent autoblub for the entire journey home, mortifying the old man next to me who desperately tried to find another seat. I played it on loop for weeks. I still miss him loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nosheen Iqbal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSGhuT_gCk" title="Dancing in the Dark Bruce Springsteen"&gt;Dancing in the Dark – Bruce Springsteen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were heading out of London on a red summer's evening, the car jerking through the choked suburbs on our way to Devon. A Springsteen compilation was on the CD player, and it came to the big hit single. The one with those facile lyrics about how this gun's for hire, even if we're just dancing in the dark. "You can't start a fire," Springsteen sang as the song neared its conclusion, "worrying 'bout your little world falling apart," and suddenly – unaccountably – my eyes were streaming, the road turning blurry in front of me. Why was I crying? Was I harbouring some subconscious worry about my own world falling apart? Was it the middle-aged awareness of the fragility of happiness that made me tear up? I still don't know. But since then, every time I've played that song while driving – but, oddly, only while driving – the result has been the same. My wife's response? Don't play it in the car; you'll get us all killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Hann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/12T95RHGLH8"&gt;After the Goldrush – Neil Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everything by Neil Young makes me weepy; the way he sings "Because I'm still in love with you" on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVi0UvFu8Yo" title="Harvest Moon"&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/a&gt;, the bittersweet pitch of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_41mycm9dow" title="Unknown Legend"&gt;Unknown Legend&lt;/a&gt;, his, frankly, underrated use of the vocoder on the experimental 1980 album Trans. OK, maybe not the last one. It's mainly nostalgia on my part, because my dad used to play his music when doing the washing- up (which was every night; mum made dinner, dad did the dishes). But his 1970 song After the Goldrush gets me every time. Young brings together a vision of mother nature reaching her peak, with the quietly stirring chord change from D major to G, and an occasionally desperate tinge to his voice. The meaning of the song is the subject of continued debate, though the general gist seems to be of two diverging themes; the pillaging of earth, and of the human body, and images of futuristic advancement – portentous dreams of silver spaceships, and the like. You keep expecting the song, usually just played with piano and the occasional harmonica, to reach a dramatic climax, but instead it fades away. It always makes me think of someone nearing the end – "I was lying in a burned out basement with the full moon in my eyes" – looking back on their life with fond regrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosie Swash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/44DlAkJVlPc" title="Mendelssohns Octet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendelssohn's Octet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cry all the time at music. The last occasion was on Monday, during the reprise of the theme of the Goldberg Variations, played in Sitkovetsky's arrangement for strings in a concert by the Britten Sinfonia. I can be relied on to cry listening to Lorraine Hunt Lieberson's recording of As With Rosy Steps the Morn from Handel's oratorio Theodora – the emotional intensity invested in this apparently simple aria by Hunt Lieberson, a great artist who died cruelly young, is staggering. But the piece I'd nominate is the first movement of Mendelssohn's Octet. When I was a child, it was used as the theme music for a Radio 4 adaptation of The Mill on the Floss and, with its passionate, bounding energy laced with a melancholy yearning, I've always associated it with Eliot's heroine, Maggie Tulliver. Last year I played it, very badly, for the first time, with friends including my partner. It's quite demanding music and I never thought I'd be able to do it. I certainly had a cry after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlotte Higgins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niXOQHZjHug" title="Leave Right Now  Will Young"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave Right Now – Will Young&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former deputy editor of NME I shouldn't really admit to the fact that it's a Will Young song that can bring a tear to my eye. Yet of all the music I've been exposed to, it's pop songs that have always affected me the most. In the late autumn of 2003, when this record came out, I was definitely emotionally susceptible to it; the song's sad lyric, in which Young faces up to the fact that a relationship has to end as continuing it is too painful, pretty much described what was going on in my life at the time. Yet I'm sure the record is moving in its own right, too. Will's singing is completely English; dignified, buttoned-up even; the tune is country-tinged and classic. Somehow the combination powerfully conveys how torn you can feel in that awful situation: trying to show a brave face to the world when you're heartbroken; summoning up the will to extricate yourself from someone destructive, even though you love them. When Young sings: "If I lose the highs, at least I'm spared the lows," the catch in his voice gets me every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Needham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSwzlxdwjNg" title="I See A Darkness  Bonnie Prince Billy "&gt;I See A Darkness – Bonnie "Prince" Billy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you know how much I love you, is a hope that somehow you can save me from this darkness". It's with these words – sung in a frayed, despondent sigh over minimal piano and distant drum splashes - that Bonnie "Prince" Billy, aka Will Oldham, can reduce me to a quivering wreck. I first heard the song after leaving university to move back home, the idea being to get a temporary job, save some money and start my life proper. Two and a half years later I was stuck working in a call centre, depressed and lost. In among the darkness the song describes, however, there's a spark of hope and the line about holding on to the love of other people is just crushingly beautiful in its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Cragg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/OJrjoRx_sMk" title="I Found a Reason  Cat Power"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Found a Reason – Cat Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Several years back I was on an assignment in Massachusetts. It was January, in the midst of a particularly harsh winter, and I spent my days sleeping and my nights driving. I listened a lot, on my night drives, to Cat Power's album The Covers Record. This is her version of a Velvet Underground song. It's only two minutes long, a song boiled down to spare piano and a dusty voice, but there's something about it that makes my insides buckle. It is somehow forlorn and vulnerable and desperate and defiant all at once. In my favourite line she sounds half-bold and half-broken: "What comes is better than what came before," she sings; it always brings me to tears. That January was a peculiarly lonely time in my life, and I remember driving with the roads empty and the snow falling heavily, feeling that this song seemed a distillation of what it meant to love and be lost, and all the frailty of being human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Barton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/_K64s6Lp8ZU" title="A Child of Our Time  Michael Tippett"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Child of Our Time –  Michael Tippett&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tippett's oratorio never fails to make me weep. It was written during the second world war and inspired by the murder in Paris of German diplomat &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_vom_Rath" title="Ernst vom Rath"&gt;Ernst vom Rath&lt;/a&gt; by Jewish teenager &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_Grynszpan" title="Herschel Grynszpan"&gt;Herschel Grynszpan&lt;/a&gt;. The assassination sparked the Nazi attacks on Germany's Jewish population which have come to be known as Kristallnacht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tippett combines his own densely textured music with a group of traditional African-American spirituals, and it is at the conclusion of the hour-long piece that the tears invariably well, when the music wrestles painfully with the horror of all that has occurred before dissolving into the immensely powerful spiritual Deep River, pointing the way across the Jordan "to the gospel feast. / That promised land, / Where all is peace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be religious to feel the power of this sentiment. This surely is what occurs at the end of all life – we are reconciled to what has been, we await our common end. Tippett was a conscientious objector in the war, and went to prison for his views. In A Child of Our Time he is standing back from the conflict, refusing to take sides, envisaging the universal peace and reconciliation that will follow unimaginable suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen Moss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOw8KrGDGHc" title="Turn It Into Love Kylie Minogue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn It Into Love –  Kylie Minogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989 I was 11 years old, I'd just started secondary school and I'd fallen in love for the first time. The girl in question somehow did not jump at the chance of being my girlfriend, and my love was unrequited. After one particularly mortifying Saturday afternoon when she saw me in the Wimpy with – the horror of it all! – my family, I got home and put the first Kylie album on. Most of the songs on that first album were about bad luck and uncertainty and lostness – that's why she became queen of everything – but track eight made me cry that day more than the others. I probably listened to Turn It Into Love on repeat for about three hours. Fortunately I had no idea in 1989 that this fruitless obsession was going to continue at least until the end of the 90s. These days the song makes me cry a bit because it feels as if it represents the start of a teenage life I probably didn't make the most of and can never get back, but that's still far less traumatic than the memory of being spotted eating a burger with my mum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Robinson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-miQ6_FTtN0" title="St Matthew Passion - Bach"&gt;St Matthew Passion – Bach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've never understood how music makes me cry. It's just a truism that it happens, often without warning, rhyme or reason. Sometimes it's because of a personal connection - the Shostakovich Preludes and Fugues my grandfather loved the most, which we listened to together, or the Bruckner symphony I associate with our family home in the highlands of Scotland - but the welling-up can also come completely out of the blue. As a student, Stravinsky's Abraham and Isaac reduced me to tears in the middle of a microscopic structural analysis of how Igor chose the notes, as if I had suddenly seen the soul of the music. But then, for sentimental reasons, songs by Sondheim, the Pet Shop Boys, and Björk also turn me into a blubbering wreck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there's one piece for me that combines the musical, the personal, and the existential in an inescapably tear-jerking combination: the final chorus from Bach's St Matthew Passion. It's music that defines compassion, lament, and loss, to which you can only surrender in moist-eyed wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what makes  Westminter's rockiest MPs cry?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la9RJbmdloY" title="A Man Needs a Maid  Neil Young"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Man Needs a Maid – Neil Young&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know it's politically incorrect to those in the feminist camp, but it's such a haunting song. Young had obviously reached a bad stage in his life, but the backing by the London symphony orchestra makes it luscious. I'd also have to choose It's A Motherfucker by Eels. The raw emotion of Mark Everett's voice hits the spot every time I listen to it. Joni Mitchell's A Case Of You, Elvis Costello's Shipbuilding and Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, from the film Platoon, have similar effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Johnson, Labour MP &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4cNiEplXuM" title="Goodbye  Steve Earle "&gt;Goodbye – Steve Earle &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of MP4 (a rock band made of MPs) I've often reduced people to tears, though not necessarily for the right reasons. Being half-Irish and half-Welsh, I'm a bit of a sucker for sentimental music. I'm a big fan of Earle, and especially Goodbye, which is a spare, pared-down song about a love affair in Earle's lost years. Halley Came To Jackson by Mary Chapin Carpenter is another corny song that never fails to move me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Brennan, Labour MP and MP4 guitarist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Interviews by James Harker)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/classicalmusicandopera"&gt;Classical music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dorianlynskey"&gt;Dorian Lynskey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timjonze"&gt;Tim Jonze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/evawiseman"&gt;Eva Wiseman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewclements"&gt;Andrew Clements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rebeccanicholson"&gt;Rebecca Nicholson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexispetridis"&gt;Alexis Petridis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nosheen-iqbal"&gt;Nosheen Iqbal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michaelhann"&gt;Michael Hann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rosieswash"&gt;Rosie Swash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlottehiggins"&gt;Charlotte Higgins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexneedham"&gt;Alex Needham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michaelcragg"&gt;Michael Cragg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/laurabarton"&gt;Laura Barton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stephenmoss"&gt;Stephen Moss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterrobinson"&gt;Peter Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tomservice"&gt;Tom Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Orange Pekoe, a speciality tea room and cafe in the modern style – all jazzy, expensive wallpapers and tastefully deployed vintage chintz – exudes that gentle atmosphere. Its calm cheerfulness is particularly welcome over breakfast. The morning menu stretches from freshly baked pastries to Scottish smoked salmon and cream cheese on toasted muffins, and includes the Pekoe Florentine (£6), where the expected hollandaise is replaced (presumably with calorie-counting yummy mummies in mind) with fresh spinach and a dressing of olive oil. The irony tang of the spinach and the grassy, pungent oil work surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the daytime menu runs the tarts-salads-sandwiches gamut, with everything from breads to pies made from scratch on site. The takeaway sandwiches (£3.90) looked good, and the baking is top notch. A piece of fudge-like chocolate brownie was full of dark berry fruit flavours. Incidentally, Orange Pekoe might specialise in fine teas (60 loose leaf or flower teas, £3.60 a pot) but it isn't pretentious. For those who require something dark and strong to kick start their day they also serve a robust, subtly earthy breakfast blend in a proper big mug. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Breakfast £1.30-£8, sandwiches/meals, £4.50-£8.50. 3 White Hart Lane, SW13 (+44 (0) 20-8876 6070, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://orangepekoeteas.com/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;orangepekoeteas.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Santa Maria Pizzeria, Ealing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this Neapolitan-owned pizzeria has a wood-fired pizza oven. That's unremarkable these days. Few restaurateurs, however, would go to the trouble of bringing over a fourth-generation Italian specialist to build said oven, using handmade bricks prepared from specific sands and clays from around Vesuvius and the Amalfi coast. Such is the determination at Santa Maria to produce superlative pizza. And Ealing clearly appreciates that effort. On a Thursday evening, this small, neat, off-grey space – dominated by a striking image of Santa Maria di Merino, a maroon patchwork on a huge plywood board – was hot and busy with people picking up takeaways and squeezing in at the tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the sandwich, pizza is at its best when it is kept to a few superb ingredients, and Santa Maria's &lt;em&gt;bufalina&lt;/em&gt; exemplifies this. The base is foldable, paper thin in the middle, expertly charred and ringed with a springy edge. Essentially, it's a shallow pool of vibrant, seasoned tomato pulp and exquisite, melting buffalo milk mozzarella. At times, it is like eating a pizza topped with double cream. Superb. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Pizza £4.50-£8.95. 15 St.Mary's Road, W5 (+44 (0) 20-8579 1462, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.santamariapizzeria.com/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;santamariapizzeria.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hereford Road Restaurant, Notting Hill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you would expect from a graduate of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/fergus-henderson" title=""&gt;Fergus Henderson's St John&lt;/a&gt;, chef-owner Tom Pemberton specialises in common-sense cooking. His kitchen works diligently to extract maximum flavour from often neglected ingredients (skirt steak, mutton, mackerel etc) and Pemberton tries to keep the prices down accordingly. At £13, the two-course set lunch is excellent value, but with this feature's self-imposed £10-a-head price limit in mind, the express lunch (£9.50 for a daily changing no-choice main course, a glass of wine and coffee) is an absolute steal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sample plate of lentils and roasted quail was great. Cooked-down with rosemary, garlic, onion and spinach, the lentils were fragrant, alive with flavour and rendered to a fraction-past-al-dente perfection. The quail, whilst not the tastiest game bird ever, was supremely juicy, the skin well seasoned and crisp. Washed down with a glass of light, nicely tannic Portuguese table wine, it was a thoroughly enjoyable 45-minute break. Service is spot on and the restaurant itself is a light, coolly modern space. Foodies will appreciate the two-person booths opposite the open kitchen where you can earwig on the chefs as they work their way through the service. It was unspectacular stuff. This is a venue where, you sense, Ramsay-style meltdowns would be anathema. But, nonetheless, it was interesting listening in on the comments and instructions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Express lunch £9.50. 3 Hereford Road, Westbourne Grove, W2 (+44 (0) 20-7727 1144, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.herefordroad.org/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;herefordroad.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clarke's Shop, Kensington&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All diplomatic number plates, small dogs in rain coats and ludicrously expensive designer sunglasses, Kensington is an unlikely place to stop off in search of good, affordable food. But this deli-cafe next door to &lt;a href="http://www.sallyclarke.com/about.php" title=""&gt;Sally Clarke&lt;/a&gt;'s flagship restaurant is a useful address to note. Something of a pioneer in her day, Clarke has been promoting the virtues of simple, sensible, seasonal cooking at these premises for more than 25 years. The shop's tiny, 10-seater cafe section, however, could do with freshening up. The service lacked the kind of warmth and dynamism you might expect and the tables weren't being cleared promptly between guests. A sample breakfast croissant – a delicate pillowy mound – was fine but not quite the zinger expected. It all felt a little glum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which was in stark contrast to the takeaway samples from the deli counter. A slice of celeriac and parmesan tart (£3.10) and a Gloucester Old Spot sausage roll (£3.25), were both very, very good. Still warm from the restaurant kitchens, they were clearly baked by somebody of considerable skill who loves what they do. Go, buy, eat on the run, and Clarke's will brighten your day. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Eat in: breakfast £1.90-£6, lunch £2.90-£7.80. Takeaway snacks and sandwiches: £1.50-£4. 122 Kensington Church Street, W8 (+44 (0) 20-7229 2190, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sallyclarke.com/shop.php" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;sallyclarke.com/shop.php&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mr Falafel, Shepherd's Bush&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is that brings you to Shepherd's Bush, be it BBC Television Centre, Queen's Park Rangers Football Club or Westfield shopping centre, do not miss &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/apr/07/features.weekend8" title=""&gt;Mr Falafel&lt;/a&gt; or Abu Zaad (below). The former is found at the entrance to Shepherd's Bush market, where, from a simple cafe unit, Ahmad Yassine dispenses nutty, herby crisp-fried falafel of a remarkable fluffy lightness in various wraps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompaniments such as hummus, tahini sauce, pickled turnips and cucumbers add layers of spiky flavour. In the deluxe version the fried cauliflower florets are sensational and the "fried potato" pieces (actually, cold chips) work better than you might think. It's a dynamic dose of carbs. There is mint or orange blossom tea, alongside the usual soft drinks. Wholly vegetarian, the Mr Falafel menu is largely vegan-friendly, too. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Falafel wraps from £3. Open 11am-6pm, closed Sunday. Units T4-T5, New Shepherd's Bush Market, Uxbridge Road, W12 (+44 (0) 7798 906668, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mrfalafel.co.uk" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;mrfalafel.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abu Zaad, Shepherd's Bush&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little bit of downtown Damascus on the Uxbridge Road, this buzzy Syrian restaurant – all carved wood and ornate Arabic brasswork, satellite TV and genial bustle – offers eye-opening food at remarkably low prices. Syria shares many dishes with its Middle Eastern and eastern Mediterranean neighbours (hummus, tabbouleh, Lebanese fattoush salad, moussaka, Moroccan tagines and myriad grilled kebabs) and, naturally, the aubergine plays a significant role in the Abu Zaad kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moutabal – one of the many starters which can also be eaten as a meze-style selection – is grilled aubergine blended with lemon juice and sesame oil to produce an intensely smoky, yet unusually sour thick wet paste. It certainly gets the saliva glands going. Makloba, meanwhile, is a dish of rice, aubergine, lamb and pine nuts cooked together in a special sauce, which has none of the heat you might expect. Instead, the dish is full of warm, savoury woodland flavours, like a wild mushroom risotto. There is no alcohol at Abu Zaad, but its exotic fresh juices (£1.75) are brilliant. A blitzed lemon and mint juice was the colour of the Incredible Hulk, perfectly balanced, and one of the most refreshing things I have ever tasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Takeaway/eat-in prices: wraps from £2.25, starters from £2.50/£3, mains from £4.50/£5.50. 29 Uxbridge Road, W12 (+44 (0) 20-8749 5107, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abuzaad.co.uk/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;abuzaad.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mr Christian's, Notting Hill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally opened by chef Glynn Christian – famous in the 1980s as the resident cook on BBC's Pebble Mill at One and Breakfast Time programmes – this delicatessen has been driving up food standards in Notting Hill for some 37 years. Now owned by wine merchants Jeroboams, it may not have the sleek designer looks or the eat-in cafe of its newer rival, the Grocer on Elgin, just across the road, but it's a little bit cheaper, and, from what I sampled, just as tasty. The daily takeaway menu includes the shop's own hot pasta bakes, soup, samosas, salads, various pies, sausage rolls (£1.10, and a little too heavily seasoned with sage and pepper, in my opinion) and seriously good cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Christian's sandwiches (pre-prepared, but that morning) are as fresh as the proverbial daisy and generously loaded with good things. Everything about a sample salmon and cream cheese bagel (the dense, chewy, almost sweetish bagel; the rich, thick, sharp cream cheese; the bright, lightly cured salmon; the fastidious scattering of fresh chives and ground pepper) was testament to Mr Christian's enduring quality. The staff are engagingly friendly, too. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Snacks from £1, sandwiches/ meals £3.20-£6. 11 Elgin Crescent, W11 (+44 (0) 20-7229 0501, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mrchristians.co.uk/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;mrchristians.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;White Horse, Parson's Green, Fulham&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White Horse is famous for two things: beer and its popularity with braying hoorays. Thankfully, on this visit, the former (eight well kept real ales from £2.80 a pint) were far more in evidence than the latter. On a sunny Thursday evening, this handsomely polished Victorian boozer seemed to have attracted a reasonably diverse cross section of west London life, and the room was suffused in that easy-going good cheer that is generated by that great leveller: good beer. Harveys Sussex Bitter, Adnams Broadside and Fuller's Chiswick are the pub's regular real ales and a sample pint from the guests – Brewster's zesty Hophead – was in excellent condition. The White Horse also carries a very impressive selection of draught and bottled lagers, US and continental beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foodwise, there are various good quality sandwiches (eg. home-cured honey roast ham; deep-fried cod cheek with lettuce and salad cream) available until 6pm, and, outside of that, bar snacks of the ploughman's (£7.50), potted crab, pork pie and homemade piccalilli variety. A sample rare roast beef sandwich (£5.60) was a good size, all the components were fresh and the horseradish had a decent kick to it. The beef was a touch fridge cold at first, but it had good flavour when it warmed up a little. On the bank holiday weekend of 29 April-2 May, the White Horse hosts the Hop-Forward Beer Festival, with a barbecue and hog roast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Sandwiches and bar snacks £4.50-£8.25. 1-3 Parson's Green, SW6 (+44 (0)20-7736 2115, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whitehorsesw6.com/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;whitehorsesw6.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Books for Cooks, Notting Hill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The self-explanatory Books for Cooks is also home to the Test Kitchen – a bright little cafe space, the walls painted colourfully with pictures of De Cecco pasta packets, artichokes and aubergines – which every lunchtime puts some of those recipes from the shelves through their paces. Quality is high, prices remarkably low (three courses, £7) and you have to get here early (around 11.45am), to secure one of the 20 or so seats. Otherwise, you might squeeze in just after 1pm, as people begin to drift away, but the kitchen stops serving at 1.30-2pm latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily menu typically consists of a starter, a main and several cakes, with customers free to eat as much or as little as they wish. A sample plate of Turkish-style chicken with black-eyed beans was boldly flavoured peasant food at its best. A moist leg and nicely crisped thigh arrived atop a tomato and bean stew which had a good long flavour and a surprising paprika heat. It wasn't a huge portion, but it was a filling lunch and, at £4, incredibly good value. It is ironic, of course, that wealthy Notting Hill has such an affordable resource on its doorstep (the middle-class chatter here is of media careers;  you may recognise some of your fellow diners from Newsnight Review), but it would be churlish to resent that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, get down here. Treat yourself to lunch. It will be £7 plus your tube fare well spent. The staff, incidentally, are happy to chew over the details of the dishes with interested foodies, after which you can get back to browsing the shelves for that must-have study of Tudor cake decoration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;• One course £4, two for £5, three for £7. 4 Blenheim Crescent, W11, (+44 (0) 20-7221 1992, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.booksforcooks.com/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;booksforcooks.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tosa, Hammersmith&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the door sits a 15kg box labelled "premium grade restaurant charcoal". An indication that Tosa is not your typical Japanese restaurant. Yes, it serves sushi, sashimi and familiar &lt;em&gt;udon&lt;/em&gt; noodle and tempura mains, but the real draw here is that robata charcoal grill at the front of the restaurant, where the chef prepares his grilled &lt;em&gt;kushiyaki&lt;/em&gt; skewers (from under £2). If you are one of those people who likes the raw visceral simplicity of smoky, caramelised, lightly charred meats, then Tosa will transport you to hog heaven. Literally in the case of the &lt;em&gt;butabara&lt;/em&gt;, a grilled skewer of pork belly upon which the rectangular pieces of fat crisp up into a kind of supra-bacon. The chicken livers (rich, velvety, carrying a little tang from their marinade) and the ox tongue are not to be missed. The texture of the latter may be more squid than steak, but ox tongue, here seasoned with salt and lemon, delivers a sensationally beefy flavour – better, in fact, than most modern beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only potential problem at Tosa is that, at £10-a-head, the four or five skewers you can squeeze in for that money may not quite fill you up, if it's your main meal of the day. In that case, if there are two of you, pool your cash, share a main noodle dish, drink tap water, and then spend the rest on skewers. You won't regret it. Alternatively, Tosa does takeaway, so if you're passing at lunch, drop in and pick-up some grilled &lt;em&gt;uzura&lt;/em&gt; (quail's eggs) or &lt;em&gt;torikawa&lt;/em&gt; (chicken skin). Tosa also does a full-meal lunch deal including a main dish, rice, miso, salad etc for £11. &lt;br /&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Skewers from £1.70, mains £6.60-£10. 332 King Street, W6 (+44 (0) 20-8748 0002, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tosauk.com/" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;tosauk.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).

A new film depicts their plight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Harold Haig was 10 years old, a man in a suit came to visit. "He said to me, 'Would you like&amp;nbsp;to go to this wonderful place called Australia where the sun shines all day every day and you pick oranges off the trees, live in a little white cottage by the sea and ride a &amp;nbsp;horse to school?'" remembers Haig, who is 73 but looks younger, with Pete Postlethwaite cheekbones and flowing white hair. "While I was letting this sink in, he added, 'Well, you know you're an orphan, your parents are dead, you've got no family, you might as well go.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haig was one of 7,000 children from British care homes who were shipped mostly to Australia and Canada between the second world war and 1967. The scandal of the lies and abuse suffered by these child migrants was exposed thanks to the tireless work of Margaret Humphreys, a social worker from Nottingham, who, in 1987, took it upon herself to help them find their families. As &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2011/feb/07/oranges-and-sunshine-trailer-video" title=""&gt;Oranges and Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;, a moving new film by Jim Loach – son of Ken – shows, Humphreys defied death threats to discover the truth about these former child migrants and their past lives. When Haig begins to talk, it is eerie because his softly spoken words and manner exactly resemble those of Jack, a traumatised former child migrant in the film who is played by Hugo Weaving. The British-Australian actor met and talked to Haig about his experiences before taking the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the man in the suit talking of oranges and sunshine, Haig barely remembers anything of his childhood in Britain. "Because of my lack of memories, I may as well have been born in Australia when I was 11&amp;nbsp;years old," he says, bleakly. He was sure he had a sister called Marie, but he could not remember anything at all about his mother: no image, no voice, no smell. "Just a blank. An absolute blank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by other "orphaned" children, the voyage to Australia was an adventure ("we ran riot"). When Haig arrived, he was dispatched to a Church of England boarding school in Melbourne. Other child migrants were less fortunate, as Oranges and Sunshine reveals through the story of Len, played by David Wenham. Many ended up in the care of the notorious Christian Brothers where they were treated as slave labour and suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse. One victim told an official inquiry that&amp;nbsp;his Christian Brother carers competed to become the first to rape him 100 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haig escaped such trauma – he would be beaten with a strap if he did anything wrong – but, as he says: "The&amp;nbsp;thing missing in an institution for children is that there is no love. You get punished but there is no one there to put their arm around you and say it's OK." One of many powerful scenes in Oranges and Sunshine is when the character based on Haig falteringly explains how he feels: "There's an emptiness in me. There always has been and I think the only thing that could fill it was her, my mother." Haig says something similar when he talks of how he married, had three children and established a successful signwriting business: "Anyone would've thought there's a fella who's got everything, but it was like I had a block of ice inside me. I felt empty. I knew I was missing something. I couldn't work out what it was. And there was this feeling – I didn't know who I was. I didn't know where I'd come from. I didn't belong to anybody. I was in this void."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, Haig sank into a deep depression. He was prescribed antidepressants, saved them up and swallowed them all. "I wanted to die. I&amp;nbsp;wanted to go to sleep and not wake up to get rid of this pain, this emptiness," he says. His wife, normally a good sleeper, woke up and saved his life. He wishes he hadn't tried to take his life at home, while his children slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "beautiful" younger sister he was always convinced he had eventually traced him through the Salvation Army. Marie had been separated from their mother and Haig, and raised in care homes in Britain; unlike Haig, she remembered her sibling. One day, in 1987, Marie told him she was coming to Australia with a social worker, Margaret Humphreys, who she wanted him to meet. Haig, by then divorced and wandering the Australian outback ("I don't know what I was looking for"), was unimpressed. "I'd seen a lot of social workers and I had no respect for any of them," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Oranges and Sunshine shows Humphreys struggling to win the trust of some child migrants, Haig quickly came to respect her. She was the first to raise the possibility that Haig had been told a terrible untruth – that he might not be an orphan after all. "I&amp;nbsp;didn't think anyone would be so cruel to tell you that sort of a lie," he says. He is amazed by &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/mar/20/emily-watson-oranges-sunshine-interview" title=""&gt;Emily Watson&lt;/a&gt;'s performance as Humphreys in the film. "I could've been watching Margaret," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haig visited Britain for six months in 1989 to get to know Marie, who passed away 14 years ago, and to help Humphreys track down his mother. With so little record-keeping by the authorities, still in denial over the scale of the trauma they created, it took another few years for them to get confirmation that Haig had not been an orphan. His parents had separated during the war, and with two children, no benefits and no relatives nearby, his mother had been forced to give up her son and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphreys discovered Haig's mother had lived two miles from where he was kept in homes (eight institutions in 14 months before he was&amp;nbsp;"deported" – as the former child migrants say – to Australia) and had died just a year before he first visited Britain. The belated release of more suppressed information 10 years ago also helped Humphreys, who was awarded a CBE this year, finally identify Haig's deceased father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No photographs remain of his mother, and Haig will forever wonder why he was given up and whether his mother tried to find him. As Oranges and Sunshine shows, parents were often deceived by the authorities and told their children had been adopted or even that they were dead. "Mothers went to their graves never knowing that their children were still alive, and happy, and well," says Haig. "It's&amp;nbsp;criminal. I don't know what worse you can do to people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did this happen? For the British authorities, a one-way ticket to Australia was cheaper than looking after children in care homes. For the Australian government, petrified they would be overrun by Asian immigrants, white children were ideal&amp;nbsp;fodder for the racist "White Australia" policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd apologised to child migrants. "It's a day we'll never forget," says Haig, who is secretary of the &lt;a href="http://www.childmigrantstrust.com/intl-association" title=""&gt;International Association of Former Child Migrants and their Families&lt;/a&gt;, and is still good friends with Humphreys. Gordon Brown followed with an apology on behalf of the British government a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trauma of all these state-sanctioned lies and abuse has left a long, scarring legacy. Haig is still estranged from his two daughters who&amp;nbsp;felt deserted when his depression destroyed his marriage. "They think I abandoned them, and in many ways I did. I had trouble looking after myself," he says, anguish in his voice. He has since been reconciled with his son, and he hopes the film might yet bring him back together with his&amp;nbsp;daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Margaret did for me and for thousands of child migrants is to give us back our lives, give us back our identity, and shine a light in where there was just darkness." Where would he be without Humphreys? "I have my doubts about whether I'd be here alive," he says. "You should ask, where would all of us be?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection"&gt;Child protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/social-history"&gt;Social history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/social-care"&gt;Social care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family"&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickbarkham"&gt;Patrick Barkham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

My long-term girlfriend (who was a virgin before meeting me) is a fabulous woman and a great friend, and we have thought about settling down together by the end of the year. However, she expects me to do everything when we are in bed, which makes me mad and I lose my desire. I don't get an instant erection as I used to earlier, but instead I must stroke it for a while. Is it normal?  Or shall I check with a doctor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your girlfriend is inexperienced, and not a mind-reader. You need to let her know you would appreciate it if she occasionally took the initiative. Tell her exactly what you'd like her to do and how. Impart this information in a gentle and encouraging manner. Begin by praising her for something she does that you enjoy, then follow up with "But I'd also love it if you'd try to . . ." or "I would prefer it if you would . . ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, this approach will also make you a better lover and improve the pleasure for both of you, because she will eventually feel safe enough to educate you about her specific needs in a similarly thoughtful fashion. Contrary to popular belief, good sex does not occur naturally and spontaneously; it requires practice. Your plans to settle down make it even more important that you learn better sexual communication, because you will frequently need those skills. Not having an instant erection does not mean there's anything wrong. As you get older, you will probably take even longer, and will continue to require direct stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• Email your problem to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="private.lives@guardian.co.uk" title="private.lives@guardian.co.uk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;private.lives@guardian.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/sex"&gt;Sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/relationships"&gt;Relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/pamelastephensonconnolly"&gt;Pamela Stephenson Connolly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Auto-Tune belongs in pop's toolkit</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/apr/07/tom-ewing-auto-tune</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/43432?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Two+years+ago%2C+the+death+of+Auto-Tune+seemed+like+a+smart+prediction.+In%3AArticle%3A1542227&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Kate+Bush%2CJay-Z%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CHip-hop+%28music+genre%29&amp;c5=Pop+Music&amp;c6=Tom+Ewing&amp;c7=11-Apr-07&amp;c8=1542227&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=Tom+Ewing+on+music+%28series%29&amp;c25=Music+blog&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FKate+Bush" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;It may resemble the aural equivalent of Photoshop, but the best uses of Auto-Tune are often the ones that play up the stylisation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make: I&amp;nbsp;like&amp;nbsp;Auto-Tune. Or maybe that should be: I still like it. Thirteen years after Cher's Believe, and&amp;nbsp;two years after Jay-Z pronounced it dead, I'm still excited by that effects box and the robotic gurgle it induces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of it, I admit, is that Auto-Tune is&amp;nbsp;so furiously hated by so many music fans. The American critic Jonathan Bogart has even talked about it as a generational break point in pop history, one of those moments, like the advent of&amp;nbsp;the electric guitar, when many established listeners simply couldn't understand or approve of what they heard. This seems extreme for something that's generally dismissed as a fad. Two years ago, when Jay-Z released his anti-Auto-Tune rant DOA (Death of Auto-Tune) it seemed like a smart prediction. Instead, the technique has settled into the toolkit of pop and now crops up in some very unusual places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Bush, for instance, whose comeback single sounds slathered in&amp;nbsp;Auto-Tune. The theme of Deeper Understanding – first released 22 years ago on The Sensual World – justifies it: it's about a woman who falls in love with a piece of software. But appropriate or not, it sparked a fan outcry: the thought of Bush – with her warm, human voice – using Auto-Tune seemed horrifying. Or,&amp;nbsp;to be less charitable, they were snobs &amp;nbsp;appalled by Bush using something that, as one BBC commenter put&amp;nbsp;it, reminded them of "mall music".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I defend it, I ought to make clear exactly what I'm defending: "Auto-Tune" has shifted meaning from&amp;nbsp;simply a brand of pitch-correction software to a catchall category of vocal manipulation. Broadly speaking, the technique corrects errors, and it ought to work in such a way as to be invisible to the non-audiophile listener. So there are two main uses for Auto-Tune: discreet, to smooth over errors; and overt, the kind of heavy vocal treatment that draws attention to itself. In fact, any example of Auto-Tune from the last&amp;nbsp;few years is really of musicians deliberately misusing the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the conversation about Auto-Tune gets this showy use of it jumbled up with the invisible enhancement of records and performance, but the two are very different. Discreet Auto-Tune is trying to make you hear a performance as pitch-perfect. Flagrant Auto-Tune is drawing attention to the artificial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can sympathise with some criticisms of the former use, but not so much the latter. Let's use a fashion metaphor: if a&amp;nbsp;model on a magazine cover has been Photoshopped to look thinner, and you learn that later, it provokes very different reactions from seeing that model with startling makeup or a fabulously concocted hairstyle. People who hate Auto-Tune often treat it as if it was Photoshopping the voice, but more often it works as a kind of vocal styling. In which case, why wouldn't Bush – an artist with a long history of playing with her voice – use it? As it turns out, the treated parts of the new Deeper Understanding are the most daring and interesting: it's her untreated voice that&amp;nbsp;sounds clotted and stumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best uses of Auto-Tune are often the ones that play up the stylisation. Some of the most creative come from outside western pop: Champion DJ's Baako, which Auto-Tunes a crying baby to disturbing effect; or DJ Maryam's Iranian techno-pop, in which the technique is used to turbocharge the melisma that characterises a lot of Middle-Eastern pop. But even the use&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Auto-Tune in our Top 40 seems harmless – the Black Eyed Peas, for instance, are not trying to fool anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you just loathe the sound of it, that's fair enough. But there's little need to feel threatened by Auto-Tune: with Adele breaking chart records every week, there's no sign that the untreated voice is doomed. There's little sign of Auto-Tune vanishing, too, which suits me fine. After all, I started listening to music in the early 80s, when artifice and pop were the same thing. I'd no sooner remove Auto-Tune from a song than I'd ask Adam Ant to take off his pirate togs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/kate-bush"&gt;Kate Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jayz"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/hip-hop"&gt;Hip-hop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-ewing"&gt;Tom Ewing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

According to a senior BBC natural history source, the project, due to be formally approved soon, indicates that the 84-year-old may soon be calling it a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attenborough is due to return to the BBC this autumn with a seven-part series called Frozen Planet, following the cycle of the polar seasons, which took three years to film and saw him film at the north pole for the first time. "He was much more involved in the making of this than he has been with other series and is on screen a lot more," said the BBC source, who added it was unlikely Attenborough would make another large-scale project for the corporation along the lines of Frozen Planet or his other epic series, such as Blue Planet or Planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frozen Planet took three years to film and David braced seriously cold temperatures that most people, let alone someone in their eighties, could not endure. These projects don't happen very easily and I'd be very surprised if he makes another major BBC natural history series," said the senior source. "He is 85 this year and you cannot go on forever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of Frozen Planet Attenborough will deliver what the BBC source called a "big polemic" on his views of nature and the environment in what the insider identified as something akin to a final word on his life's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode, called Meltdown, will be a "look at what the future might hold for the animals and people that live at the poles and what these changes might mean for the rest of us", according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The poles – north and south – look superficially very similar, but when you visit them within a few weeks of one another, as I have just done, you realise how profoundly different they are – and how what is happening to them is going to affect the entire planet," Attenborough said in pre-publicity for this autumn's series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A century ago the poles were just about the most inaccessible places on earth. Today that has changed. Nonetheless, to have visited them both within a few weeks of one another is a huge privilege."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation about when he would stand down has long dogged Attenborough. In 2005 he told the Sunday Times that his work up until then had "given a series to every group of animals" and that he had made "enough".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially the BBC denies that Attenborough's career will be over after 2012 and Attenborough himself remains defiantly hopeful that he will go on. He is filming another 3D film for Sky about botanical work at Kew Gardens in south-west London. This follows his 3D film Flying Monsters for the broadcaster last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I will be making Life Stories for 2012 to mark the anniversary, and I am not sure how much original filming it will involve," he said . Asked if he would continue with his filming work, he said: "I sincerely hope so, yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;BBC's elder statesman&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is almost impossible to imagine the BBC without Sir David Attenborough, just as it is difficult to picture the presenter and naturalist making programmes for anyone other than the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attenborough, who will be 85 in May, makes genuinely popular programmes with a strong educational element, the type of content that even the corporation's most vehement critics habitually applaud. Few, if any, broadcasters embody the BBC's mission statement to educate and inform more fully  than he does. At times his name has been employed by executives as a two-word riposte to accusations it was dumbing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Attenborough first applied to join the BBC in 1950 as radio producer, his application was rejected but he was offered a job in TV. Four years later he presented the first edition of Zoo Quest, which ran for a decade. His 1979 series, Life on Earth, was the most ambitious natural history series ever undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Attenborough had a long spell as a BBC executive between the two landmark shows. He was the first controller of BBC2 when it launched in 1965, introducing the coverage of snooker when the channel went colour in the early 70s. Other programmes commissioned by Attenborough included Civilisation and The Ascent of Man. He could probably have been director general if he had wanted to, but has confessed he had no desire to lead the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he went back to making programmes, all of them multiple award-winning, including Blue Planet in 2001 and Planet Earth five years later. As an elder statesman of the BBC he has occasionally criticised the corporation, telling the Radio Times earlier this year its "sails need to be trimmed". He is currently working on a 3D series for Sky, perhaps the BBC's most bitter rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Robinson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough"&gt;David Attenborough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary"&gt;Documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/wildlife"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/bendowell"&gt;Ben Dowell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Commodore 64 lives again!</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2011/apr/07/commodore-64-returns</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/44690?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Commodore+64+lives+again%21%3AArticle%3A1542884&amp;ch=Technology&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Games+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CRetro+%28games+genre%29%2CWindows+%28Technology%29%2CWindows+7&amp;c5=Corporate+IT%2CGames&amp;c6=Keith+Stuart&amp;c7=11-Apr-08&amp;c8=1542884&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Blogpost&amp;c11=Technology&amp;c13=&amp;c25=Games+blog&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FTechnology%2Fblog%2FGames+blog" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;The C64, a legend of the 8bit era, is set to return – with brand new insides!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of the most successful home computers of the eighties and now it's making an unlikely comeback. A &lt;a href="http://www.commodoreusa.net/CUSA_C64.aspx"&gt;new version of the Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt; is set to be released this summer, featuring entirely modern innards including a 1.8ghz dual-core Intel Atom D525 processor, Nvidia Ion 2 graphics chipset, 2 GB of DDR3 memory and your choice of a DVD or Blu-ray drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of all, the revived machine will feature exactly the same design as its 8bit predecessor, right down to the beige body and chunky keyboard (you can see more images on the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Commodore-USA/181491231869072"&gt;Commodore USA Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;). The old cartridge port and joystick interfaces will be gone, though, replaced with HDMI and USB connections. Users will also be able to install Windows 7, although the machine will ship with Linux and will eventually get its own Commodore OS 1.0, complete with an emulator to play classic C64 titles. The new device is apparently on sale now, and orders are being taken at the price of $595 (£364), although at the moment, the company's website seems to be struggling to cope with the amount of interest a PC in a brown plastic box is generating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the original Commodore Business Machines declared bankruptcy in 1994, the brand has passed through a number of hands in the subsequent years. It is now jointly shared by the creator of the new C64, Commodore USA, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.commodorecorp.com/"&gt;Commodore Holdings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.commodoregaming.com/pcshop/Country.aspx"&gt;Commodore Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, which builds high-spec PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the big question is, which classic C64 titles should be updated along with the machine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/games"&gt;Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/retro"&gt;Retro games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/windows-7"&gt;Windows 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/keithstuart"&gt;Keith Stuart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

His editor&amp;nbsp;Michael Pietsch explains how he pieced the manuscript together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, 10 years after the publication of &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/03/news/infinite-jest.html" title=""&gt;David Foster Wallace's &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; Little, Brown made plans to release an anniversary edition of that glorious novel. Celebrations were planned for bookstores in New York and Los Angeles, but as the events neared, David demurred about attending. I telephoned to try to persuade him. "You know I'll come if you insist," he said. "But please don't. I'm deep into something long, and it's hard for me to get back into it when I'm pulled away." "Something long" and "a long thing" were the terms David used to talk about the novel he'd been writing in the years since &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;. He published many books in those years – story collections in 1999 and 2004 and gatherings of essays in 1997 and 2005. But the question of a new novel loomed, and David was uncomfortable speaking about it. Once when I pressed him, he described working on the new novel as like wrestling sheets of balsa wood in a high wind. From his literary agent, Bonnie Nadell, I heard occasional reports: David was taking accounting classes as research for the novel. It was set at an IRS tax return processing centre. I had had the honour of working with David as his editor on &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;, and had seen the worlds he'd conjured out of a tennis academy and a rehab centre. If anyone could make taxes interesting, I figured, it was him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/sep/15/2" title=""&gt;David's death in September 2008&lt;/a&gt;, I had not seen a word of this novel except for a couple of stories he had published in magazines, stories with no apparent connection to accountancy or taxation. In November, Bonnie joined Karen Green, David's widow, to go through his office, a garage with one small window at their home in Claremont, California. On the desk Bonnie found a neat stack of manuscript, totalling nearly 250 pages. On the label of a disk containing those chapters he had written "For LB advance?" Bonnie had talked with David about pulling together a few chapters of his novel to send to Little, Brown in order to commence negotiations for a new contract and advance against royalties. Here was that partial manuscript, unsent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring David's office, Bonnie and Karen found hundreds and hundreds of pages of his novel in progress, given the title &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt;. Hard drives, folders, three‑ring binders, spiral‑bound notebooks and floppy disks contained printed chapters, sheaves of handwritten pages and notes. I flew to California at their invitation and two days later returned home with a green duffel bag and two sacks heavy with manuscripts. A box full of books that David had used in his research followed by mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading this material in the months after, I found an astonishingly full novel, created with the superabundant originality and humour that were uniquely David's. As I read these chapters I felt unexpected joy, because while inside this world that David had made I felt as if I were in his presence, and was able to forget awhile the awful fact of his death. Some pieces were neatly typed and revised through numerous versions. Others were drafts in David's minuscule handwriting. Some – those chapters from the desk among them – had been recently polished. Others were much older and contained abandoned or superseded plotlines. There were notes and false starts, lists of names, plot ideas, instructions to himself. All were gorgeously alive and charged with observations; reading them was the closest thing to seeing his amazing mind at play upon the world. One leather‑bound workbook was still closed around a green felt marker with which David had recently written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere in all these pages was there an outline or other indication of what order David intended for these chapters. There were a few broad notes about the novel's trajectory, and draft chapters were often preceded or followed by David's directions to himself about where a character came from or where he or she might be headed. But there was no list of scenes, no designated opening or closing point, nothing that could be called a set of directions or instructions for &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt;. As I read and reread this mass of material, it nevertheless became clear that David had written deep into the novel, creating a vividly complex place – the IRS Regional Examination Center in Peoria, Illinois, in 1985 – and a remarkable set of characters doing battle there against the hulking, terrorising demons of ordinary life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen and Bonnie asked me to assemble from these pages the best version of &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt; that I could find. Doing so has been a challenge like none I've ever faced. But having read these draft pages and notes, I wanted those who appreciate David's work to be able to see what he had created – to be allowed to look once more inside that extraordinary mind. Although not by any measure a finished work, &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt; seemed to me as deep and brave as anything David had written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In putting this book together I have followed internal clues from the chapters themselves and from David's notes. It was not an easy task: even a chapter that appeared to be the novel's obvious starting point is revealed in a footnote, and even more directly in an earlier version of that chapter, to be intended to arrive well after the novel begins. Another note in the same chapter refers to the novel as being full of "shifting POVs, structural fragmentation, willed incongruities". But many of the chapters revealed a central narrative that follows a fairly clear chronology. In this story line, several characters arrive at the Peoria Regional Examination Center on the same day in 1985. They go through orientation and begin working in and learning about the vast world of IRS tax returns processing. These chapters and these recurring characters have an evident sequence that forms the novel's spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other chapters are self‑contained and not part of any chronology. Arranging these freestanding sections has been the most difficult part of editing &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt;. It became apparent as I read that David planned for the novel to have a structure akin to that of &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;, with large portions of apparently unconnected information presented to the reader before a main story line begins to make sense. In several notes to himself, David referred to the novel as "tornadic" or having a "tornado feeling" – suggesting pieces of story coming at the reader in a high‑speed swirl. Most of the non‑chronological chapters have to do with daily life at the examination centre, with IRS practice and lore, and with ideas about boredom, repetition and familiarity. Some are stories from various unusual and difficult childhoods, whose significance gradually becomes clear. My aim in sequencing these sections was to place them so that the information they contain arrives in time to support the chronological story line. In some cases placement is essential to the unfolding story; in others it is a matter of pace and mood, as in siting short comic chapters between long serious ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;em&gt;he Pale King&lt;/em&gt;'s central story does not have a clear ending, and the question inevitably arises: how unfinished is this novel? How much more might there have been? This is unknowable in the absence of a detailed outline projecting scenes and stories yet to be written. Some notes among David's manuscript pages suggest that he did not intend for the novel to have a plot substantially beyond the chapters here. One note says the novel is "a series of setups for things to happen but nothing ever happens". Another points out that there are three "high‑ end players . . . but we never see them, only their aides and advance men". Still another suggests that throughout the novel "something big threatens to happen but doesn't actually happen". These lines could support a contention that the novel's apparent incompleteness is in fact intentional. David ended his first novel in the middle of a line of dialogue and his second with large plot questions addressed only glancingly. One character in &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt; describes a play he's written in which a man sits at a desk, working silently, until the audience leaves, at which point the play's action begins. But, he continues, "I could never decide on the action, if there was any". In the section titled "Notes and Asides" at the end of the book I have extracted some of David's notes about characters and story. These notes and lines from the text suggest ideas about the novel's direc‑ tion and shape, but none strikes me as definitive. I believe that David was still exploring the world he had made and had not yet given it a final form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pages of the manuscript were edited only lightly. One goal was to make characters' names consistent (David invented new names constantly) and to make place names, job titles and other factual matters match up throughout the book. Another was to correct obvious grammatical errors and word repetitions. Some chapters of the manuscript were designated "Zero drafts" or "freewriting", David's terms for first tries, and included notes such as "Cut by 50% in next draft". I made occasional cuts for sense or pace, or to find an end point for a chapter that trailed off unfinished. My overall intent in sequencing and editing was to eliminate unintentional distractions and confusions so as to allow readers to focus on the enormous issues David intended to raise, and to make the story and characters as comprehensible as possible. The complete original drafts of these chapters, and the entire mass of material from which this novel was culled, will ultimately be made available to the public at the University of Texas's Harry Ransom Center, which houses all of David's papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David was a perfectionist of the highest order, and there is no question that &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt; would be vastly different had he survived to finish it. Words and images recur throughout that I am sure he would have revised: the terms "titty‑pinching" and "squeezing his shoes", for example, would probably not be repeated as often as they are. At least two characters have doberman hand puppets. These and dozens of other repetitions and draft sloppinesses would have been corrected and honed had David continued writing &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt;. But he did not. Given the choice between working to make this less‑than‑final text available as a book and placing it in a library where only scholars would read and comment on it, I didn't have a second's hesitation. Even unfinished, it is a brilliant work, an exploration of some of life's deepest challenges, and an enterprise of extraordinary artistic daring. David set out to write a novel about some of the hardest subjects in the world – sadness and boredom – and to make that exploration dramatic, funny and deeply moving. Everyone who worked with David knows well how he resisted letting the world see work that was not refined to his exacting standard. But an unfinished novel is what we have, and how can we not look? David, alas, isn't here to stop us from reading, or to forgive us for wanting to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/publishing"&gt;Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/david-foster-wallace"&gt;David Foster Wallace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction"&gt;Fiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;
